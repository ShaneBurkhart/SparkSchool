Hey there!

We're glad you are interested in what we are doing!

We want to make it easy for you to create awesome electrical devices. If there's anything in particular that you want to learn, feel free to reply and let us know.

You will be kept up to date on all of our progress.  At some point we will release a beta product that you will have the opportunity to try before launch.  This will help us get feedback from you to improve the product.

We can't wait to get you started!

Thanks,
The Spark School Team
