The first thing we need to do is create a directory (folder) for our project.  

We could create a folder by using our mouse and right clicking on our Desktop, but let's do it on the command line instead.  Open up the program called "Git Bash" on Windows or the program called "Terminal" on OS X/Linux.

<p class="info">
"Command line" and "terminal" are names for the same thing and are used interchangeably.  On Windows, I'm referring to the program called "Git Bash" and on OS X/Linux, I'm referring to the program called "Terminal".
</p>

![Image of empty terminal]()

You should see a screen with a blinking cursor similar to the one above with different colors more than likely. 

This is the command line and we use it to run programs on our computer. Each command is a single line and we use the enter key to run a command.  You can try running the "pwd" command by typing the following into your terminal and pressing enter.

##### Terminal on your computer
```bash
pwd
```

<p class="info">
The first line of every code snippet in this course is where it should belong or where it should be executed.  In this case, we need to run the "pwd" command in the terminal on your computer.
</p>

![Image of pwd command]()

You should see the terminal print something like the above.  This is the file path to the current directory.  Each terminal window you have open has a "current working directory", which is the directory we are currently in on the terminal.  In the case above, we are in the "shane" user's "home" directory which is also "~" for short.  

The Desktop is like any other directory on your computer and is always in the user's home directory.  The file path for the Desktop is "~/Desktop".  Let's navigate there with the "cd" command.  Type the following in your terminal and press enter.

##### Terminal on your computer
```bash
cd ~/Desktop
```

![New command prompt after cd command]()

You should see the command line prompt change to show you are in the Desktop directory. This is a quick place you can look to see which directory you are currently in.

The "cd" command is a little more complicated than the "pwd" command.  Let's break down the anatomy of a terminal command.  We'll use the following as an example.

##### Example terminal command
```bash
ls -l ~/Desktop
```

Each part of command is separated by a space.  In the command we have three parts: "ls", "-l", and "~/Desktop".  The first part is always the program (also referred to as "command") we are running.  "ls" is actually a program on our computer that we are referencing.  You can see where a program's file exists by running the "which" command.

![Which command for ls]()

The next part is called a flag which sets option for the program we are running.  Command line flags start with either a single dash "-" or a double dash "--" followed by the flag name.  The "-l" flag above is a lowercase L and tells the "ls" command to list details about the files it finds.

<p class="info">
Usually single dash flag names are a single character and double dash flag names are words.
</p>

The third part of the above command is "~/Desktop" and is called a parameter.  Every part that is not a flag or the program we are running is considered a parameter.  Parameters are used to give information to the program we are running.  In our case, we are telling the "ls" command to print the contents of the the "~/Desktop" directory.

<p class="info">
Flags and parameters are specific to each program you run.  Each program will have it's own set of flags and parameters it takes.
</p>

Now that you know the basic anatomy of a terminal command, let's create our project directory on the Desktop and name it "BudgetApp".  We are going to use the "mkdir" command which takes a directory to create as a parameter.

##### Terminal on your computer
```bash
mkdir BudgetApp
```

Now change your current working directory to our new project directory with the "cd" command.  Since we are currently working in the Desktop directory where our project directory exists, we don't have to specify the full path.  Instead, we can just give the child directory name we want to change to.

##### Terminal on your computer
```bash
cd BudgetApp
```

We are now in our project directory.  Let's create a README file and make our first git commit to the project.  In your terminal, use the "touch" command to make a file called "README.md".

##### Terminal on your computer
```bash
touch README.md
```

The touch command checks if the given file exists.  If it doesn't exist, a blank file with the given name will be created and if it does exist, nothing happens.

We named our README with a ".md" file extension which is short for markdown.  Markdown is a simple format used to write text that can easily be converted to simple HTML.  If you are interested, here's a [https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax](full markdown syntax reference).

Usually README files contain a little bit of text describing the project.  Let's add a header and short description paragraph.  Open "README.md" in your text editor (Sublime Text 3) and add the following.

##### README.md 
```markdown
# Budget App

This is a subscription based personal budgeting web app written in Node.js with MySQL.  This app makes envelope budgeting online simple and has a paid a free tier.
```

Now that we have our README file, let's add it to git.

## Initialize git repository

First we need to initialize our project as a git repository.  A repository is simply what git calls each project.  To do this, we use the "git" command in our terminal and pass it the "init" parameter.

##### Terminal on your computer
```bash
git init
```

This will create a directory called ".git" that holds all of the git specific files.  You shouldn't ever modify that directory or anything in it.

<p class="info">
When a file or directory name is prepended with a period, it means it's hidden.  The "ls" command doesn't normally show these files, but you can see them with the "-a" flag.
</p> 

## The 3 stages of git

With our project initialized as a git repository, let's talk a little more about how git works.  As I mentioned earlier, git is used to take snapshots of you code called commits.

Git does two things for us:  

- **Makes it easy to collaborate on a project.** With git, two people can be working on the same file at the same time and not step on each other's toes.  We will cover more on this later when we talk about branching.
- **Keeps a history for each file.** This makes it easy to go back to previous versions of a file.  It may not seem like you would use history much, but it will actually come in handy.  There are a lot of times where you'll want to do things like reuse or reference code that was previously in a file.

![Diagram of three stages from git basics link]()

In Git, a file can be in one of three stages: working directory, staging area, and git directory.  The working directory is all of the files that have changed but are not yet staged to be committed.  The staging area is a middle group that is all of the files that are ready to be committed.  Last, the git directory stage consists of files that are safely committed and haven't changed.

If this is confusing right now, don't worry.  You'll get the hang of it quickly after your first commit or two.

## Basic git workflow

How often you commit is really a matter of opinion, but it's generally a good idea to commit frequently.  Most people will commit their code after finishing a particular piece of what they were working on.  You'll get a better feel for it as we go along in the course.

The basic git workflow is as follows:

- Make changes to a file.
- Add files to staging to be committed.
- Commit files with a short message of what you did.

We just finished making changes to README.md so we need to add our files to staging to be committed.  Before we do this, let's see which files have changed and which are in staging with the "git status" command.   Run the following in your terminal 

##### Terminal on your computer
```bash
git status
```

![git status of unstaged README.md]()

This shows unstaged file names in red and staged files in green.  As you can see above, we currently don't have anything staged and our README.md file is untracked.  A file is untracked when it isn't tracked by git yet.

<p class="info">
The git command always takes a sub command as the first parameter.  For "git status", the sub command is "status".
</p>

## Add README.md to staging

To add a file to staging, we use the "add" git sub command followed by the name of the file we want to add.  If you pass a directory, the entire directory will be added to staging.  Run the following.

##### Terminal on your computer
```bash
git add README.md
```

Let's check that our file got added to staging with "git status".

![git status of README.md staged]()

README.md is now green which means it is staged for commit.  

## Making a commit

To commit staged files, we use the "commit" git sub command.  We also want to add a message so we add the "-m" flag (short for message) and type our message after.  Run the following to commit README.md.

##### Terminal on your computer
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit with README.md"
```

Commit messages give a short description of what you did.  My commit message tells us this is our initial (first) commit and we added README.md.

If you run git status now, you won't see any files listed since everything is committed and nothing has changed.

Now that we have created a git repository and let's push it to Github.

## Create a Github account

Github is a free platform that is used to store git repositories.  This is useful for backing up your files, distributing code to other computers and showing off your work.  I recommend every developer create an account and add any code you write.  If you do this, you will quickly build an impressive portfolio of projects that will catch the eye of employers.

[Click here to create a Github account.](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)

After you create a Github account, you need to create an SSH key and add it to your Github account. 

SSH is a protocol that allows you to communicate with other computers and SSH keys provide authentication for your computer.  We'll talk a little more about SSH later.

Let's check if you have an SSH key already.  In your Terminal, run the following.

```bash
ls -a ~/.ssh
```

If you see "id\_rsa.pub" and "id\_rsa" listed then you already have an SSH key generated and you can skip this part.  

For everyone else, this [guide from Github will help you generate an SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/).

Next, we need to get the contents of our SSH public key so we can add it to our Github account. It's hard to find, so let's copy it to our Desktop with the command line.  Run the following to copy our public key to the Desktop.

```bash
cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/Desktop/id_rsa.pub
```

<p class="info">
It's important that we upload the public key.  Our public key is called "id_rsa.pub" and is safe to give out since it's public.
</p>

Now you can open this file in Sublime Text and copy it's contents.  Now go to your Github account and click on your user thumbnail in the top right.  Select "Settings" in the dropdown.

![Settings in Github dropdown]()

On the left hand side, click "SSH and GPG keys".  On the top right side of that page, there's a button to add a "New SSH key".  Click that and a couple of text inputs will appear.  Give your's a title like "Macbook" and paste the contents of your public key into the "Key" box.  When that's done, press "Add SSH key"

![New SSH key button highlighted with new text fields as well]()

When it asks you to enter a file to save the key, press Enter.  Next, it will ask you for a password and password confirmation.  Add a password to your SSH key.  The characters will be hidden as you type.



Once you create a Github account and add an SSH key, you need to create a new repository for your project.

## Create a Github repository

We now have a Github account, but we need a place to store our Git repository.  To do this, we need to create a new repository on Github.

To create a new repository, click the little plus sign in the top right or the site navigation.  When you see the dropdown, click "New repository". 

![Github create repository button]()

The next screen will ask for repository details. All we need to do is give our Repository a name. 

![Github create repo page with name filled in]()

Click the "Create repository" button and you will create your repository.  

Let's get the address of out Github repository so we can tell our local Git repository where to push our code to.
