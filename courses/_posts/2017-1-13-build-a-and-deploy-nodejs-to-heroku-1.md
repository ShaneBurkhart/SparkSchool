I am running this tutorial on a Mac.  If you are on Windows or Linux, a few things will be slightly different.  I make a note of these things, but if you have issues, leave a comment and I'll check it out.

You need to do these things before getting started.  Don't worry, all of the tools and services we use in this tutorial are free!

### Install Node.js

Visit [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the installer for your operating system. Run it and use the defaults.

If you're on Linux, [here's a guide to installing Node.js on Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04).

### Install Git

Git is a version control tool that Heroku uses to deploy web apps.  Visit [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the installer for your operating system.  Run it with the default settings.

### Install a text editor

When coding, it's important to have a good text editor.  You can use whichever you want, but I recommend [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com).  Visit [https://www.sublimetext.com/3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) and download the installer for your operating system.  Run it with the default settings.

### Create a Heroku account

Creating a Heroku account is free and easy.  Visit [https://signup.heroku.com/](https://signup.heroku.com/) to create an account.

### Install Heroku toolbelt

We need to also install the Heroku toolbelt so we can interface with Heroku from our project.  [Here's a guide to install Heroku toolbelt](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).
