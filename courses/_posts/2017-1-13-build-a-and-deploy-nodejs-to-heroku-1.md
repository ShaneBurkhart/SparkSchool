I am running this tutorial on a Mac.  If you are on Windows or Linux, a few things will be slightly different.  I make a note of these things, but if you have issues, leave a comment and I'll check it out.

Before we get started, you need to do the following things.  Don't worry, all of the tools and services we use in this tutorial are free!

### Install Node.js

Visit [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the installer for your operating system. Run it and use the defaults.

If you're on Linux, [here's a guide to installing Node.js on Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04).

### Install Git

Git is a version control tool that Heroku uses to deploy web apps.  We'll talk a little more about Git later.  For now, visit [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the installer for your operating system.  Run it with the default settings.

### Install a text editor

When coding, it's important to have a good text editor.  You can use whichever you want, but I recommend [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com).  Visit [https://www.sublimetext.com/3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) and download the installer for your operating system.  Run it with the default settings.

### Create a Heroku account

Creating a Heroku account is free and easy.  Visit [https://signup.heroku.com/](https://signup.heroku.com/) to create an account.

### Install Heroku toolbelt

We need to also install the Heroku toolbelt so we can interface with Heroku from our project.  [Here's a guide to install Heroku toolbelt](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

With everything set up, you're ready to create your project!
