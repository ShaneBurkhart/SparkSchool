In this tutorial, I'm going to teach you how to build a web app and deploy it to the web.  Since this is a beginner's guide, let's define what a web app is.

**What's a web app?** Web app is short for web application and is a broad term referring to just about any website that interacts with a user. This can range from something as complex as Facebook to something as simple as a web page with a form. For this tutorial, we are going to build a web app using Node.js that has a home, contact, and about page. From there, you can modify your web app to your own website's needs.

**Why Node.js?**  Node.js is a free program that runs Javascript (a programming language) files. Node.js is great for beginners due to its simple interface and it is quickly becoming one of the best options for building web apps.  Paypal, LinkedIn, and Netflix are just a few companies that are built on Node.js. With its easy-to-use interface and growing popularity, Node.js is the ideal way to build your first web app.

**What about deploying to the web?** To deploy your app to the web, you need a server to run your code. For this guide, we are going to use Heroku. Usually setting up a server is a tedious process, but Heroku does all the heavy lifting so you can focus on only writing code. Heroku is hands down the easiest server provider I've found and the best part is it's free!

In this beginner's guide, I'll show you how you can not only get started with Node.js but also launch your very own web application from start to finish.

Let's get started!

		<h3>Meet The Instructor</h3>
		<p>Hey, I'm Shane! I’ve been a software developer for a little over 5 years now, and have worked at Yelp, Carfax, and a startup called SumoMe.
		<p>The crazy part is I didn’t go to school to be a software developer. In fact, I am completely self-taught.</p>
		<p>I've spent the last 5 years teaching myself software development and over time, I have learned what works and what doesn't. Now, I want to use my knowledge to help you learn as efficiently as possible.</p>
