In the previous tutorial, I gave you the HTML code for each web page, but now it's time to learn how to make your own. Today you will learn how to create and style web pages with HTML and CSS!

This is the start of the second project! The second project is quite a bit bigger than the first, so I've split it up. For the next 3 weeks, I will send you learning resources to build project 2.

If you haven't finished the tutorial yet, don't worry.  You can still start on project 2 and come back to the last tutorial later.

## Learn HTML and CSS

As I mentioned above, you are going to learn HTML and CSS today. Let me explain what each of these does.

Every web page uses HTML and CSS to render web pages. HTML is used to define the structure of elements on a web page while CSS is used to position and style those elements.

<p class="info">
To give you an example, HTML defines a paragraph and its text, while CSS defines font weight, color, and size.
</p>

Both of these languages have a simple syntax, so you don't need to spend a lot of time learning HTML or CSS intimately. Instead, I recommend learning basic syntax and using a reference for the rest.

Once you know basic syntax, you can practice by creating your own web pages.  Since HTML and CSS are used for every website, you will quickly learn them.

## HTML and CSS Course

There are numerous resources available that will teach you HTML and CSS, but Codecademy's is one of my favorites.  I added a link below so you can get started.

[Codecademy has a good tutorial on HTML and CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web)

This HTML/CSS course should take about a week to complete.

## HTML and CSS References

Once you understand how HTML and CSS works, you can use the following links for references.

[HTML reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

[CSS reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)
