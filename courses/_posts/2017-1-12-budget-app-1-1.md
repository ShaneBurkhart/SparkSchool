Before we can start coding, we need to install a few tools.  Some tools are specific to certain operating systems.  Read through the whole section to make sure you have everything you need.

###Installing VirtualBox

Unfortunately, Windows doesn't have nearly the dev tools or support that a Unix based operating system (OS X or Linux) has.  Because of this, the industry standard is to use a Unix based operating systems to develop on.  We'll be doing the same since it makes the most sense.

We are going to develop in a virtual machine (VM) to make sure everyone is developing on the same operating system.  A virtual machine creates a fake computer, running on your current computer, that we can log into and use just like any other computer

Our VM is going to be running Ubuntu which is a version of Linux.  Even if you are running OS X or Linux already, I recommend using my VM since I have already installed a lot of things for you and it the course will be easier to follow. All of what we learn will transfer over to OS X or or other distributions of Linux anyways.

For our VM software, we are going to use VirtualBox.  Go to [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and download the correct version for your operating system. Open the file that was downloaded and follow the instructions to install VirtualBox.  Just use the default settings.

We won't be using VirtualBox again.  We only needed to install it and Vagrant will handle managing VirtualBox.

###Installing Vagrant

VirtualBox is used to create VMs but that's about it.  With VMs there is generally a lot of configuration that has to be done.  Because of this, we are going to use a program called Vagrant to manage a VM for our project.

All we have to do is define a file that tells Vagrant how to set up our VM and Vagrant does the rest.  We'll talk more about this later.

To install Vagrant, go to [https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and download the appropriate version for your OS.

###Installing Sublime Text 3

We need a good text editor to write code.  My personal favorite text editor for beginners is Sublime Text 3.  Sublime Text 3 does a nice job of being easy to use while also including a lot of important tools if you want them.

To install Sublime Text 3, go to [https://www.sublimetext.com/3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) and download the version for your operating system.  Open the file you downloaded and use the default settings.

###Install Git

Git is a code version control tool used to take snapshots of your project's code at a given time.  Almost every software project uses git since it makes collaborating with other people easy.  

As well as making collaboration easy, git also keeps a history of what you've worked on so you can easily go back to an old version or recover some code that you previously deleted. This will save you from a lot of mistakes you might make.

**check that we use default settings**

To install git, visit [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the version for your operating system.  Open the file you downloaded and use the default settings.

This will also install a program called "Git Bash" which we will use later.

###Install Chrome Browser

The default web browsers on Windows and OS X (Edge & Safari) are good for browsing the web, but lack developer tools we need. Instead, we need to use either Chrome or Firefox. My personal favorite is Chrome so we are going to use it in this course.

Go to [https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) and download Chrome.  Run the installer when it finishes downloading.
