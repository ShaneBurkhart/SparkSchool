If you've thought about building a web app, you've probably asked yourself these questions: **"How do I get started?", "What do I learn first?", "Am I making mistakes?"**

When I started teaching myself how to code, I asked myself those same questions. I had no idea where to start and no one to point me in the right direction.  Needless to say, I made plenty of mistakes, and it took me much longer to learn than it probably should have.

**It doesn't have to be that way for you!**

Because I know how hard it is to get started, I created this tutorial as a starting point for learning web development.  Since we're starting at the beginning, let's define what a web app is.

**What's a web app?** Web app is short for web application and is a broad term referring to just about any website that interacts with a user. This can range from something as complex as Facebook to something as simple as a web page with a form. For this tutorial, we are going to build a web app using Node.js that has a home, contact, and about page. From there, you can modify your web app to your own website's needs.

**Why Node.js?**  Node.js is used to write web servers in the Javascript programming language and is quickly becoming one of the best options for building web apps.  Paypal, LinkedIn, and Netflix are just a few companies that are built on Node.js.

**What about deploying to the web?** To deploy your app to the web, you need a server to run your code. For this guide, we are going to use Heroku. Usually setting up a server is a tedious process, but Heroku does all the heavy lifting so you can focus on only writing code. Heroku is hands down the easiest server provider I've found and the best part is it's free!

In this beginner's guide, I'll show you how you can not only get started with Node.js but also launch your very own web application from start to finish.
