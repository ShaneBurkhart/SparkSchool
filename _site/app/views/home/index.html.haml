          %h3 We don't give you an Arduino, we teach you how to make one.
          %p Most kits are based around an Arduino, which is great, but doesn't provide the level of learning need to make production devices.  A higher level of circuit and microcontroller knowledge is needed to be able to design functional circuit boards.  With our kits, you will learn to design your own microcontroller circuits and printed circuit boards.

            Our kits contain everything you need to construct microcontroller circuits, plus so much more.  We have thought long and hard about the projects you may create, and we have come up with a full kit.
