                h2 Develop on your computer
                p A lot of coding courses don't teach you how to build projects on your own computer. Instead, they teach you how to write code in a web browser.  This misses the entire point!
                p
                    b Professional developers write code on their own computers so why wouldn't you?

                    b &nbsplike you would at a real software company.

                    | To get a job as a software developer, you need a portfolio of projects. Unfortunately, you probably don't have the knowledge to build a project on your own yet.

                p

                h2 Meet The Instructor
                p Hey, I'm Shane! I’ve been a software developer for a little over 5 years now, and have worked at Yelp, Carfax, and a startup called SumoMe.

                p The crazy part is I didn’t go to school to be a software developer. In fact, I am completely self-taught.

                p Probably not unlike some of you, when I first started learning to code, I didn't know what I was doing so it took me much longer than it should have to learn. My goal is to fix that. This course is designed so you don't ever have to go through the same unnecessarily long process I did.

                p I've spent the last 5 years teaching myself software development and over time, I have learned what works and what doesn't. Now, I want to use my course to help you learn as efficiently as possible.
