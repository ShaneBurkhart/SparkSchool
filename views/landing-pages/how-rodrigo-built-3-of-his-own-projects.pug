                h2 He Tried Other Resources
                p At the age of 37, Rodrigo decided it was time to start a career as a software developer.  He tried various resources like Lynda and Codecademy, but settled on free code camp.
                p After getting 25% of the way through, he realized he needed to learn more than just how to code.  He needed to learn how to build his own project.
                p Rodrigo tried other resources but nothing seemed to fit.  That is until he found my course.

                p 7 days after starting the course, Rodrigo built his first web app from scratch, but he wasn't sinished.
                p With his new knowledge from the course, Rodrigo was able to transform the website he just built in a Hacker News opinion forum.
                p He posted his project to Hacker News and was greeted with a surprise. Someone was attacking his website!
                p Luckily, my course taught him how to secure his site against common vulnerabilities so the attacker had no luck!

                h2 How is my course different?
                p Most courses assume you already have some kind of knowledge.
                p They don't teach you anything practical that you can use.
                p This course has you working on your own computer and will learn most efficiently.
