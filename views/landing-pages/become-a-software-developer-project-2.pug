                ul
                    li Code a web server in JavaScript using Node.js
                    li Build and style web pages with HTML and CSS
                    li Read and write to a database using SQL
                    li Run commands in the terminal
                    li Deploy your app to the web with Heroku

                p A lot of coding courses teach you how to code, but don't leave you with anything practical. This course teaches you how to build a real use case web app.  We'll cover everything you need to know from writing code on your computer to deploying your Twitter clone to the web.

                p Learning how to build an entire web app is a lot to cover so the course makes sure to teach you only what you need to build your own web apps.  It isn't useful to dive into learning something that you aren't going to use.
