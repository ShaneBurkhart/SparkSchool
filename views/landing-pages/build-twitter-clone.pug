                h2 Start at the basics
                p If you've tried or thought about building a web app, you've probably asked yourself these questions: "How do I get started?", "What do I learn first?", "Am I making mistakes?" This course starts with the basics and assumes you have no programming experience.

                h2 Learn efficiently
                p Learning how to build an entire web app is a lot to cover so the course makes sure to teach you only what you need to build your own web apps.  It isn't useful to dive into learning something that you aren't going to use.
