                h2 Build A Twitter Clone
                p My first course for the platform is going to be a six-week course to build a Software as a Service (SaaS) web app with subscription payments. We will dive deeper into the concepts we learned building the Twitter clone course, while also incorporating professional level development tools and techniques. It won’t be officially released until March, but with Beta access you’ll get the first week’s lesson two weeks from now.
